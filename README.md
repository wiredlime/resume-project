1. Fix the minor white 'bounce' space at the top and bottom of the site.
2. VW units usage: "humans generally have a set range of font sizes that are comfortable to read, regardless of how big or small the window is"

1. Code is well-organized and easy to read however in real production, we may want to also clear the comment (those in style.css).
This page looks great on desktop, but not mobile devices. If you have the time, try make it responsive. Here a hint for it (style css @media, google this). 
2. Also, VW units usage: "humans generally have a set range of font sizes that are comfortable to read, regardless of how big or small the window is" 
Can not argue with this ! So i would recommend change your font size to 14-18px.
